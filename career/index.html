					<p>Nearly a century has elapsed since the inception of closed-circuit television (CCTV). Over time, it has undergone various adaptations, yet a fundamental constraint endures: the need for constant 24/7 human surveillance. This limitation has led to a recurring issue, particularly in the Philippines, where emergencies have been overlooked, resulting in responders arriving only after the events have concluded. What if there existed a technology capable of autonomously alerting responders? What if, instead of relying on CCTV cameras, communities employed audio processing technologies to detect emergency situations? Such a system could be deployed in banks, actively listening for keywords like "holdup" to trigger immediate emergency alerts. Similarly, public transportation could benefit from this technology, given that holdups are common in urban areas during late hours when response times are extended. Developers have also introduced a mobile version that offers analogous functionality, listening for emergencies and serving as a personal bodyguard, even in low-light conditions. RPIEAS and the EarTags system rely on voice recognition, enabling users to summon assistance even when incapacitated or deprived of sight.</p>
