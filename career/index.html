					<p>Nearly a century has elapsed since the inception of closed-circuit television (CCTV). Over time, it has undergone various adaptations, yet a fundamental constraint endures: the need for constant 24/7 human surveillance. This limitation has led to a recurring issue, particularly in the Philippines, where emergencies have been overlooked, resulting in responders arriving only after the events have concluded. What if there existed a technology capable of autonomously alerting responders? What if, instead of relying on CCTV cameras, communities employed audio processing technologies to detect emergency situations? Such a system could be deployed in banks, actively listening for keywords like "holdup" to trigger immediate emergency alerts. Similarly, public transportation could benefit from this technology, given that holdups are common in urban areas during late hours when response times are extended. Developers have also introduced a mobile version that offers analogous functionality, listening for emergencies and serving as a personal bodyguard, even in low-light conditions. RPIEAS and the EarTags system rely on voice recognition, enabling users to summon assistance even when incapacitated or deprived of sight.</p>

						Victory Liner at JoyRide Bus, 2024
					</div>
					<p>In today's world, technology is essential to Filipinos' daily lives, transforming how they travel. JoyRide, one of the country's leading superapps and an established competitor in motorcycle taxis, introduced a seamless way for Filipinos to book bus tickets. In partnership with Victory Liner, JoyRide launched JoyRide Bus in December 2024, making long-distance travel across regions more accessible.
					</p>
					<p>This service connects passengers to key locations, including Cubao, Baguio, Pasay, Caloocan, Sampaloc, Tuguegarao, Kamias, Dagupan, San Fernando, Roxas, Olongapo, Aparri, Ilagan, Santiago, Cauayan, Baguio, Bolinao, Alaminos, Lingayen, Tabuk, Clark Airport, Iba, Dau, Sta. Cruz Zambales, and PITX, all through an online booking platform.
					</p>
					<p>This marks the second major project led by Mr. Lalusin in his career as a software engineer. Through this experience, he gained valuable insights into software engineering standards, payment integrations, cloud infrastructure, and business operations. He also had the opportunity to work with major industry technologies, including Victory Liner’s API, Maya’s payment platform, GCash integration, and Amazon’s cloud services—expanding his expertise both locally and internationally.

						Off-Grid Solar System, 2024
					</div>
					<p>Due to the unreliable power supply during typhoon season and his remote work setup, Mr. Lalusin finally built his first solar backup system to handle blackouts. He had initially relied on a 200W Car Power Inverter, but it was inefficient and consumed too much fuel. He first visited Smart Save Solar in Lipa, Batangas, where he was assisted by Engr. Mikee Bueno, but most of their products were industrial-grade, unsuitable for small-scale solar enthusiasts. As a result, he only purchased wires, MC4 connectors, and mounting materials. On December 15, 2024, taking inspiration from Daniel Catapang's solar setup, a YouTuber known for his DIY solar projects, he completed his solar setup, featuring a 100W solar panel, a PWM solar charge controller, two 25AH gel-type batteries, and a 1000W pure sine wave inverter. His system can also integrate with a vehicle's energy supply as a backup, allowing the inverter to be connected to the vehicle when the solar batteries are drained.

					<h3>2G-Based Vehicle GPS Tracking and Geofence-Based Notification System</h3>

						</div>
						Prototype Installed in Toyota, 2025
					</div>
					<p>Most commercially available GPS trackers for cars rely on data subscriptions, which are significantly more expensive in the Philippines. Engineer Lalusin seeks a cheaper alternative by using SMS instead of mobile data. For this project, he utilizes a NEO-6M GPS chip and a SIM800L V2 GSM module, connected via an Arduino Nano. The device operates on old 2G technology, which remains a go-to network, especially in remote areas in the Philippines. It sends an alert when the vehicle starts and is detected outside a configurable geofence, set via SMS. It can also send its location on demand through specific text commands. Instead of a costly data plan that ranges from ₱300 to ₱500 per month, this setup costs only ₱1 per SMS and can be configured to send messages only when outside the geofence or when triggered through text, significantly reducing costs while maintaining reliable tracking.
