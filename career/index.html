					</div>
					<p>In the concluding semester of his computer engineering program, Mr. Lalusin encountered only two courses: Capstone 2 and Seminars and Field Trips. With five months left before graduation, on March 1, 2023, he initiated his career in the domain of Software Engineering at a Japanese company situated in Eastwood Quezon City. During this timeframe, he diligently attended online seminars while concurrently engaging in work responsibilities. Additionally, he dedicated his Saturdays to the development of their thesis prototype, undertaking a lengthy five-hour commute from the company-provided apartment to the school in Lipa City, Batangas. Despite the formidable challenges, his determination prevailed, culminating in his recognition as the Employee of the Month in September 2023. His principal role involved collaborating with both Filipino and Japanese developers, specializing predominantly in backend development to deliver web-based systems tailored to Japanese businesses. His tenure at this company also provided invaluable insights into the distinctive operational dynamics between a corporate entity and a typical startup venture.

					</div>
					<p>In pursuit of his Computer Engineering degree, Mr. Lalusin undertook an internship at a small startup firm situated in Lipa city. During this period, ARC System Solution Co. was based in Lima Outlets, a location nearly two hours away from his residence. In the face of these challenges, Mr. Lalusin remained resolute in his quest to acquire new technological knowledge and enhance his collaborative abilities. Remarkably, as an intern, he gained access to the official source code of the project within just two weeks of joining the company.</p>
					<p>His primary responsibilities encompassed the development of the mobile version of their medical information management system and the creation of a designated API for the project. He successfully implemented teleconsultation features into their system and was also tasked with incorporating an offline mode to ensure seamless functionality in areas with unreliable internet connections.</p>
					<p>Impressed by his competencies, the company extended an offer for him to lead the mobile development segment of the project. Despite his eagerness to embrace this challenge, a subpar compensation package ultimately led him to decline the offer. Instead, he chose to continue his freelance work after completing the internship, as it offered a more financially reasonable income.</p>

						<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=outsourcing.solutions.ph.skapp" target="blank">SK App</a> Launch at Baybay City, Leyte
					</div>
					<p>At 18, immediately after completing high school, Mr. Lalusin was offered the position of IT Head by a startup company dedicated to modernizing the interaction between the Sangguninang Kabataan and its constituents. Ms. Fatimary Gopez, a former client of Mr. Lalusin, was impressed by his skills and believed he would be a valuable addition to the startup team she was assembling. After completing the necessary paperwork, the company was officially founded on June 26, 2019. Mr. Lalusin, along with a group of recent college graduates, took charge of the project, which later became known as the SK App. The company gained significant momentum, with four SK Federations signing up to use the application. However, everything took a turn when the pandemic struck. The company persevered until 2021, but the economic downturn and a focus on healthcare funding brought the digitization of SKs to a standstill. Given that the company's primary target was government entities, it became evident that the pandemic was not the right time to pursue those ambitions. Despite the downfall of the company, this experience became a fundamental part of his career and played a pivotal role in developing his leadership skills. These skills would prove essential in his future roles and pursuits.</p>
					<h3>Freelance Programmer</h3>
					<p>He commenced his freelancing journey during the final semester of senior high school. Despite his youthful age, he expresses gratitude to clients who placed faith in his abilities without being deterred by his youth. His freelancing endeavors encompassed mobile application development, dot net technology systems, PHP systems, and a few machine learning projects.</p>

					</div>
					<p>During his Nissan Lipa internship, Mr. Lalusin gained valuable insights into the management of vehicle repairs and replacement parts. Exposure to automotive engineers in the Nissan Lipa Parts Department reignited his interest in pursuing one of his engineering dreams - Mechanical Engineering. The other two options he considered were Electrical and Computer Engineering. His profound fascination with machinery began to dominate his thinking, prompting him to reconsider pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering. This choice was influenced by the fact that his father had graduated in Mechanical Engineering from FEATI University. It's worth noting that Computer Engineering evolved from the electrical engineering field, which in turn has its roots in the mechanical engineering field. Understanding these connections played a pivotal role in his decision-making process when choosing his college program. And despite not pursuing Mechanical Engineering right after senior high school, the learning he gained from this experience enhanced his general knowledge in the field of engineering. His encounter with some of the automotive technicians during his internship gave him the inspiration that passion could still be pursued despite the misalignment of your college course. A good example is one of the technicians who studied computer science but decided to take an automotive course to pursue his passion.</p>

					</div>
					<p>Mr. Lalusin began his educational journey as a Day Care student at the DSWD Day Care Center in Brgy. Poblacion San Antonio, Quezon. He then continued his education with preparatory studies at Academia De San Antonio, where he successfully completed his elementary education. In 2013, he earned the prestigious title of <strong>salutatorian</strong> for Batch 2013.</p>
					<p>His pursuit of knowledge continued in high school at Manuel S. Enverga Institute Foundation Inc. San Antonio. Here, he distinguished himself by achieving the title of <strong>Highest Performing Student in NCAE</strong> for Batch 2017. Notably, he also became the <strong>topnotcher in NCAE categories</strong> like HUMSS, Visual Manipulative Skills, and Scientific Ability.</p>
					<p>During his Senior High School years, Mr. Lalusin enrolled at STI College Lipa, specializing in TechVoc-ICT. As a dedicated IT in Mobile App and Web Development student, he achieved remarkable milestones. He notably became part of the only grade 11 team to compete at the national level in the <strong>Tagisan ng Talino Codefest</strong> in 2018, securing the first runner-up position.</p>
					<p>Subsequently, he pursued a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering at the same institution. His dedication and expertise were recognized as he received the title of <strong>Design Engineer of the Year</strong> for the BSCpE Batch 2023, graduating <strong>cum laude</strong>. Additionally, he clinched the <strong>Best Capstone Design</strong> award and participated in the <strong>PacketHacks IoT Technology Hackathon</strong> at the World Trade Center - Metro Manila in the same year.</p>

					</div>
					<p>In 2023, while Mr. Lalusin was diligently working in Quezon City, he received an invitation from Mr. Justine Louis Sacdalan to join forces with Mr. Emmanuel David Arganda and Alyca Villalon, who was stepping in as a replacement for Ms. Julie Ann Mirabel, for one final codefest journey. However, their dreams of reaching the finals were dashed when the committee enforced stricter rules, barring graduating students from the competition.</p>
					<p>Fearing that his last year as an STIer would be uneventful, a glimmer of hope emerged when Engr. Mary Ann Macatangay encouraged them to submit their thesis for the upcoming PacketHacks IoT Technology Hackathon, scheduled to take place at the World Trade Center Metro Manila. On June 3, 2023, just moments before their Final Thesis Defense, Mr. Lalusin received an email informing them that they had secured a spot as one of the finalists in the IoT Hackathon, ranking among the top 4 in the Smart Property category.</p>
					<p>This development provided Mr. Lalusin and his team members, Carlo Castro, Angelo Jose Nulial, and Vince Warren Oñate, with an opportunity to demonstrate their prowess as Computer Engineers. The competition spanned from June 26 to 28, but due to financial constraints, the team could only attend the last day. Fortunately, June 28 coincided with a holiday, allowing Mr. Lalusin to participate in the demo day without compromising his role as a software engineer.</p>
					<p>On the final day, they showcased their innovative product, competing against Microsoft interns in their category, with judges hailing from both local and international companies. While they didn't clinch victory in their designated category, they left a lasting impression on the judges. One foreign judge even urged them to consider patenting their idea, recognizing the risk of larger US companies replicating it. Another judge commended their audacious approach and expressed hope that future generations would continue to push the boundaries of innovation.</p>

					</div>
					<p>In 2018, Mr. Lalusin embarked on his Codefest journey alongside Mr. Emmanuel David Arganda and Julie Ann Mirabel, representing ICT-102, a grade 11 section at STI College Lipa. Despite facing more seasoned tertiary students, they miraculously advanced in the local competition. Justine Louis Sacdalan, an STI Balayan alumnus, served as their coach. They later competed in the cluster competition at STI Calamba, encountering even tougher opponents that led to a tiebreaker in their favor.</p>
					<p>Their journey continued as they represented Cluster 4 at the national level, hosted at STI Ortigas-Cainta. This national competition involved a 72-hour hackathon to devise a business solution based on a provided case. They emerged as the 1st Runner Up that year, earning the opportunity to witness other national competitions held at STI Vigan.</p>
					<p>The team regrouped the following year but faced heartbreak after falling short in the Cluster 4 competition at STI Batangas, securing only the 2nd Runner Up position. This marked their final journey together as a team, as Ms. Julie Ann Mirabel opted to attend a different school for college.</p>
					<p>In 2020, Mr. Lalusin returned to Codefest with new members, Jose Jerome Lalunio and Kaye Angel Lanto, under the guidance of their coach, Mr. James Olependo. They sought redemption by defeating STI Las Piñas on their home turf and clinching the 1st Runner Up title in the Cluster 4 Codefest Competition. Unfortunately, this marked the conclusion of his Codefest career, as the pandemic forced the cancellation of the competition for the next two years.</p>

					<p>Nearly a century has elapsed since the inception of closed-circuit television (CCTV). Over time, it has undergone various adaptations, yet a fundamental constraint endures: the need for constant 24/7 human surveillance. This limitation has led to a recurring issue, particularly in the Philippines, where emergencies have been overlooked, resulting in responders arriving only after the events have concluded. What if there existed a technology capable of autonomously alerting responders? What if, instead of relying on CCTV cameras, communities employed audio processing technologies to detect emergency situations? Such a system could be deployed in banks, actively listening for keywords like "holdup" to trigger immediate emergency alerts. Similarly, public transportation could benefit from this technology, given that holdups are common in urban areas during late hours when response times are extended. Developers have also introduced a mobile version that offers analogous functionality, listening for emergencies and serving as a personal bodyguard, even in low-light conditions. RPIEAS and the EarTags system rely on voice recognition, enabling users to summon assistance even when incapacitated or deprived of sight.</p>
